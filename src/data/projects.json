It allows users to select source and destination points directly on the map and visually observe how algorithms explore routes step by step. The system snaps user-selected points to real road nodes to ensure accurate routing. A dynamic speed controller lets users adjust the algorithm execution in real time. The final shortest path is rendered clearly on the map using real-world road data. ",
